Robust machine learning is a rapidly growing field that spans diverse
communities across academia and industry. Consequently, keeping abreast of all
the developments in this field and related areas is challenging. The goal of
this website is to serve as a community-run hub for learning about robust ML,
keeping up with the state-of-the-art in the area, and hosting other related
activities.
